This repository contains the data and source code (models and optimization problems) discussed in the manuscript, "Assessment of Concentrating Solar Thermal 
and Photovoltaic Technologies for the Optimal Hybridization of Industrial Process Heat Systems" by Justin Rastinejad, Sloane Putnam (shared co-first authorship), and Matthew D. Stuber (corresponding author).

The source code has been tested working with JuMP v1.1.1, Ipopt v1.1.1, and EAGO v0.7.2.
