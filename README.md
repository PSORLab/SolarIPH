This repository contains the data and source code (models and optimization problems) discussed in the manuscript, "Technoeconomic Assessment of SolarTechnologies for the Optimal Hybridization of Industrial Process Heat Systems Using Deterministic Global Dynamic Optimization" by Justin Rastinejad, Sloane Putnam (shared co-first authorship), and Matthew D. Stuber (corresponding author).

The source code has been tested working with JuMP v1.12.0, Ipopt v1.4.1, and EAGO v0.8.2.
